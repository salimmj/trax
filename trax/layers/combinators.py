  """Combinator that applies layers serially (by function composition).

  This combinator is commonly used to construct deep networks, e.g., like this::

      mlp = tl.Serial(
        tl.Dense(128),
        tl.Relu(),
        tl.Dense(10),
        tl.LogSoftmax()
      )

  A Serial combinator uses stack semantics to manage data for its sublayers.
  Each sublayer sees only the inputs it needs and returns only the outputs it
  has generated. The sublayers interact via the data stack. For instance, a
  sublayer k, following sublayer j, gets called with the data stack in the
  state left after layer j has applied. The Serial combinator then:

    - takes n_in items off the top of the stack (n_in = k.n_in) and calls
      layer k, passing those items as arguments; and

    - takes layer k's n_out return values (n_out = k.n_out) and pushes
      them onto the data stack.

  A Serial instance with no sublayers acts as a special-case (but useful)
  1-input 1-output no-op.
